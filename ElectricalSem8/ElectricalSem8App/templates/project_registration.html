  <h3 >Project Aim and Description:</h3>
  The aim of this project is to specify, design, implement, populate and query a limited-scope
relational database.
This constitutes a very important practical exercise to better understand all what you have taken
during the “introduction to database” course.
The objective of this project is to understand the main phases of the development of a
relational database, and to produce the deliverable(s) of each phase: a requirement analysis
document, Entity-relationship Diagram, Relational Schema creation SQL script, Data
population SQL script and Main queries SQL script.
The project can be done individually or in teams of two students maximum. The size and scope of
the project depends on the number of students.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Project steps:</h3>
 <b>1)</b> You need first to form your team (if needed) and then to select one of the projects in the project
list at the end of this file. You should make three choices in order to solve any conflict in
students choices. You are also free to choose a project from outside the list.<br>
<b>2)</b>  Once assigned a project, the first and very important step is to do the needed re/search about the
topic/application you are intended to develop. This will help you to define the main
requirements for your project; in other words to play the customer role and present the
information storage problem which includes mainly what “the customer” is planning to store in
the database, the business rules/ constraints to respect as well as the main reports (queries) he is
expecting to have.<br>
<b>3)</b>  The next step is to draw the Entity-Relationship diagram for the database which will be then
translated into a relational schema to be implemented in SQL in a database creation script.<br>
<b>4)</b>  The database should be then populated with the minimum necessary data (in a SQL script) that
will help to validate the SQL queries you will write and which will help providing the reports
required by the customer in the first phase.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Project Scope and Complexity:</h3>

The scope and thus the size as well as the complexity of the project is very important and will play
an important role in the assessment and thus the grading of the project especially for team projects.
On the other hand, it is very important to have a “reasonable” complexity level in order to be capable
to finish the project on time (before the end of May 2021). Thus a main challenge is to define a
reasonable scope for the project; thus in some project topics, student should only consider certain
modules to be analyzed and then implemented.
Due to the importance of the aspect of the project, you should get the approval of your tutor
regarding the scope before proceeding; thus you should prepare a one to two pages concerning
the requirement specifications that clearly demonstrates that your project is “acceptable" and
“tangible" at the same time


<br><br><br>
<h3>Project Deliverable(s):</h3>
• At the end of the project, you are expected to provide a brief report that explains the
different phases of the project along with the three SQL script parts (can be merged in one
SQL file) sufficiently commented. <br>
• You are also expected to do an oral presentation (Slides and demo) in order to
demonstrate your understanding of the project (the date is to be determined later).
